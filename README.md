Interactive dashboard showing daily stock summary, interactive graph, technical indicators and closing price prediction using ML model


The dashboard is an extension and application to the 'SP500PricePredictionMLSA' project and presents a daily summary of a stock, an interactive graph and the features that were found to be particularly correlated with the closing price (the technical indicators) and allows you to see the predicted closing price for the end of the current trading cycle.
I chose to train the linear regression model, which was found to have the highest predictive abilities among the other models, on additional stocks. This time the features of each model are the stock data of a previous trading cycle or the most updated data available on the network and in addition the technical indicators that were implemented in the aforementioned project. I plan to train time series models soon as well.
